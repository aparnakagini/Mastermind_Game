# Mastermind_Game

There are two players in this game: The code maker and the code breaker. This program manages the role of the code maker.
There are 10 colors available for this version of the game and this program picks 4 different colours in random from them. You ask the user to enter their
guess. The objecttive of this game is for the code breaker (the user) to duplicate the exact colours and positions of the 4 randomized colours that the program has picked in the fewest amount of guesses. There are penalties for the user each time they don't follow the rules, and the game will end when the user exceeds 15 guesses or 5 penalties in a round.
